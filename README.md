# excel-to-sharepoint
Powershell script that pushes Excel data onto a SharePoint site.

This repo is indeed empty, it isn't glitched. Unfortunately, while copying the files from my work computer to my personal, 
I had not noticed that only the empty folders were being transferred, and the actual project was deleted with the rest of my
remaining data on the work laptop...
